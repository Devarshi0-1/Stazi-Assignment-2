## About this Project

This project is made with [ReactJS](https://react.dev/), and it's libraries. For styling I have used vanilla CSS, and [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) for client side routing. I have also used [Framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for animations, and redux toolkit for global state management. [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) was used for bundling.
